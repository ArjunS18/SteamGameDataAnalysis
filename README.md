# SteamGameDataAnalysis
•	Took Steam Data set from the kaggle website.
https://www.kaggle.com/connorwynkoop/steam-monthly-player-data

•	The key columns in the data set are (Name of the game, Average players, Gain, Gain %, Peak player count)

• Wrote functions to perform data filtering, normalizing, drawing graph and much more to enable code reuse.

• Performed Descriptive Statistics on the data as a part of exploratory data analysis

• Computed Top 10 games based on player count for any year based on input dataframe

• Visualized the output in a time series graph and made the graph interactive with Plotly package

• Performed hypothesis testing based on user input on the data. Visualized the output in normal distribution graph.

• Performed multivariate regression analysis on the data based on categorical variable month and predicted the output for future years

• Computed Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Achieved 96% accuracy with the regression model.

• For top 100 games, split the data into training and test set and performed KNN clustering based on total player count.
